                College students in the Boston area who are in or have experienced isolation/quarantine due to COVID-19 face a number of social challenges. Quarantine can be a very lonely and dark experience to navigate as it limits one's social life and ability to physically interact with others. We wanted to make something for this target population that adds some light and positivity into a negative experience by fostering social interaction online between people in the same situation. 
                <br><br>
                Greatfully helps students by connecting them with other students who are experiencing the same thing. Students can bond over shared experiences and practice gratitude during this time.

            <h3>Analysis Protocol</h3>
              <p>
              We asked our users about their experience with COVID isolation, 
              including their overall impressions, day to day experience and feelings prior to 
              and after quarantine. Next we asked if they knew anything about gratitude practices. 
              If they did, we followed up by asking if they had any experience with these practices.
              <br><br>
              All interviewees were Wellesley College students who tested positive for COVID-19 and 
              quarantined at home, on campus or at a hotel.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
              <p>
                None of our participants had any intentional gratitude practices during their time 
                in isolation. While some had experience with it in the past, it was not something 
                they were actively practicing now or during their isolation period. All of our 
                interviewees were grateful for different things during their isolation (comfort,
                 home, space, friends etc.) but, again, it wasnâ€™t something that they were actively 
                 thinking of or writing down.
              </p>
              <h3>Problem Statment</h3>
              <p>
                We observed that there is a need for community for college students in quarantine. 
                College students are used to living in communal spaces (dorms, with roommates), so 
                being in isolation can be especially hard. Interviewees expressed that they were 
                reassured by knowing that others were going through the same experience as them. We 
                plan to address this problem by providing a central platform for building a community 
                of individuals impacted by COVID-19 and quarantine. The platform suggests ways to 
                practice gratitude by responding to prompts (ex. share a positive experience, one 
                thing you are grateful for during quarantine) that will be visible to other community 
                members.
